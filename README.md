## Python BlackJack game on console only

#### From Udemy course project by Angela Yu 

This is one of the best course of Python for beginner I have found online
Has alot of hands on projects from day one, unlike other course, this one 
is structured for hands on approach rather than just follow some Python book
typing the python code along.  Instructor breaks down larger project to smaller 
sections so students can solve the problem section by section and walk through
step-by-step.  And it also goes from beginner level to advanced.

Course's name is "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro BootCamp for 2021"
It's a 63.5 hours course, grab it when Udemy has a sale, well worth the cost.
Besides, Udemy has 30 days money back policy.
