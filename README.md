#### Python Courses project from Udemy

This is a Python course project from Udemy course "100 Days of Code, Complete Python BootCamp 2021"
by Angela Yu

I found this is so far the best Python Introductory course online.
The instructor is absolutely phenomenal, but what makes it above the rest is the structure of the course.
Instead of following some Python book chapter by chapter and students types along, the course is structured
as hands-on approach, every section has its own project, large projects are broken down section by section, walk through step-by-step.  
Basically, one can only do so many for loops or while loops, this course actually teaches students to create some really world applications.
Udemy usually has sales going on every other month, wait till there is sale, pick up this course.
